# Face Recognition Using Eigenfaces

Implemented dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to generate eigenface and performed face reconstruction with eigenfaces.

## Dataset

Datasets consist of faces of 200 people and each person has two frontal
images (one with a neutral expression and the other with a smiling facial expression),
there are 400 full frontal face images manually registered and cropped.
